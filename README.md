# BernJack! Blackjack by BernDog

This started as a practice project for a csharp course _Foundation in C#_ (https://iamtimcorey.com/p/foundation-in-c-object-oriented-programming-part-2) and I decided to build out a fully working blackjack game where the player plays against the dealer, and wagers each hand until they are out of money.

### First make a wager

### Then review the hand and hit or stay

### Continually hit until you stay or bust

### When the hand is over the cards and updated wallet balance are displayed

### When the player is out of money the game is over
